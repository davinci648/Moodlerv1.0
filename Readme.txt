This robust and easy to use chrome extension allows users to efficiently handle their online course material requirements on Moodle. Moodle is a widely used open-source platform used by many universities worldwide, including our own, IIT Guwahati.

We noticed that it takes a lot of clicks and navigation to reach the required page. After reaching the page, each file needs to be downloaded one by one, a very tedious task. Our extension greatly simplifies this by automating this process. The user just needs to mention the courses they want to monitor and the extension will regularly log in to check for updates and download them. Furthermore, we also provide a unified web-page where the user can view all the courses and associated materials. This helps in monitoring for updates in each course without having to check explicitly.

Although our extension is designed for Moodle, it also works equally well on pages created by professors for distributing course material.
